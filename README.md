# deep-learning-challenge
Module 21 Challenge

This repository consists of four Jupyter Notebooks, a written analysis, and an Images folder. The purpose of this homework assignment is to create a neural network model that can predict whether an organization will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Jupyter Notebooks
<i>Each of these notebooks was written and run in Google Colab.</i>
### AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb
- This file contains the code to run the original neural network model.
### AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization1.ipynb
- This file contains the code to run the first attempt at optimizing the original model to achieve an accuracy score above 75%.
### AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization2.ipynb
- This file contains the code to run the second attempt at optimizing the original model to achieve an accuracy score above 75%.
### AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization3.ipynb
- This file contains the code to run the third attempt at optimizing the original model to achieve an accuracy score above 75%.

## Neural_Network_Report.md
This file contains the full written analysis for each of the neural network models. 

## Images folder
This folder holds the images used in the analysis writeup.
